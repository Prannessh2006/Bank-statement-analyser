The Python script facilitates the extraction of tables from PDF or CSV files, converting them into pandas DataFrames. 
Utilizing tabula-py for PDF parsing and pandas for CSV reading, it handles multiple tables within a file, presenting 
each as a DataFrame. Upon extraction, the script offers visualization capabilities through matplotlib, displaying the data as
 bar charts. Users simply provide the file path, and the script guides them through the extraction process, displaying extracted tables and visualizations 
as applicable. With easy installation via pip and straightforward usage, this tool streamlines the process of data extraction and visualization from PDF and CSV sources.
